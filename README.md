Medical Appointment Scheduling System Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding patient "No-show" patterns in medical appointments to improve scheduling efficiency.

📋 Project Overview
Author: Jaehui Park

Date: February 14, 2026

Objective: To identify key factors contributing to appointment no-shows and derive actionable insights through statistical analysis.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: R (for data processing and statistical analysis)

Reporting: R Markdown rendered via Pandoc

Libraries: (Includes jQuery for interactive HTML reporting)

📊 Key Analysis Phases
The project follows a structured data analysis workflow:

Status Summary: Analyzing the distribution of appointment statuses (Completed vs. No-show).

Seasonal Analysis: Investigating how no-show rates fluctuate across different seasons.

Patient History Tracking: Quantifying past no-show counts to predict future attendance behavior.

📂 Data Outputs
The analysis generates several structured CSV files for further reporting:

status_summary.csv: Summary of all appointment statuses.

season_noshow_summary.csv: Seasonal breakdown of no-show data.

no_show_counts.csv: Frequency analysis of patient-specific no-shows.

past_appointments.csv: Historical data on previous medical visits.

🚀 How to View
The final analysis report is provided as an interactive HTML file. Simply open Medical-appointment-scheduling-system--Eng-.html in any web browser to view the full report, including code and visualizations.
