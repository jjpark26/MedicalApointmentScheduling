# Medical Appointment Scheduling System Analysis

This project analyzes a medical appointment dataset to identify patterns behind patient "No-shows" and provides insights for better scheduling management.

## 📋 Project Overview
- **Author**: Jaehui Park
- **Date**: February 14, 2026
- **Objective**: To analyze historical appointment data and determine the factors influencing whether patients attend their scheduled visits.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language**: R
- **Reporting**: R Markdown (Pandoc)
- **Visuals**: Interactive HTML Report

## 📊 Key Analysis Features
The analysis includes the following components:
1. **Appointment Status Summary**: Statistical breakdown of kept vs. missed appointments.
2. **Seasonal No-show Trends**: Analysis of how different seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) affect appointment attendance.
3. **Patient Attendance History**: Tracking individual patient behavior and past no-show counts to predict future reliability.

## 📂 Data Outputs
The analysis script generates the following summary files:
- `status_summary.csv`: General statistics on appointment outcomes.
- `season_noshow_summary.csv`: Attendance data grouped by season.
- `no_show_counts.csv`: Frequency of no-shows per patient.
- `past_appointments.csv`: Detailed record of patient appointment history.
